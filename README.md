# Notepad Encoding

*The encoding Notepad actually saved.*

## About

**Notepad Encoding** runs on your own PC. Detect and convert a text file between UTF-8 and UTF-16 for Notepad.

Notepad still writes UTF-16 sometimes. A tool then sees NUL bytes.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## Editions

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Features

- Detect
- To UTF-8
- Backup
- Preview sample

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
